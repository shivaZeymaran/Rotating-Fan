# Rotating-Fan
Embedded Real-time Systems Course
The goal is designing a Rotating Fan with FreeRTOS that is a kind of Real-time Operating Systems.

Main code is a file like .ino that contains Arduino code.

Code consits of two tasks one for DC motor and one for Servo motor. 

DC motor used for turning the Fan blades and it's speed is related to temperature that measures with a temperature sensor.

Servo motor used for turning the Fan head to left and right directions and it's speed is related to the special switch that controlled by user.
